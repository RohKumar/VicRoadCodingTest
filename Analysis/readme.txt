The files in this directory are the results of a short analysis phase. This phase was only used to generate a high-level list of candidate classes and methods, which were implemented and then refined. During development new classes emerged to take on unforeseen roles, and existing classes were broken apart in keeping with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
