Landing (on the Plateau) -- position command 
Facing (some direction) -- position command 
 
Spin (90 degrees) -- movement command 
Moving (forward one grid point) -- movement command 
 
Report (each rover's final co-ordinates and heading) 
 
Issue Commands (to a rover) 
 
Initialize (the upper-right coordinates of the Plateau) -- was 'Input' 
 
---- N/A 
Viewing (the terrain) -- not required in spec 
Navigating (across the Plateau) -- combination of Spin and Move 
Explore (the plateau) -- as above 
Send (back to Earth) -- no need to send images 
Control (each rover) -- Control, Send and Give become 'Command' 
Give (the rover’s position, as in the command line 'gives') -- see above
